Fullstack Academy Block 5 Workshop problem

Overview

The Wild Animal Mini-Zoo recently hired many new zookeeper interns who will work at the zoo for the next six months. They have contracted your team to build a page that will make it easier for the new interns to identify each animal and understand their needs and behaviors.

Remember to use the MDN documentationLinks to an external site. if you need help with keywords, methods, or something else. An internet search for "mdn <thing you are trying to do>" usually works great for getting you to the correct MDN page you want.
