            <p>
                Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and
                jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold,
                and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to
                reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is
                likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.

            <p>
                Monkeys use all four limbs—two arms and two legs—to walk and run.
                Their hands and feet are good for grasping tree branches. Monkeys have
                a coat of hair on most of their bodies. Many types have bare areas of
                skin on the face and buttocks.

            <p>
                Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils
                at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body
                is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail;
                adults have dark stripes on the tail.
